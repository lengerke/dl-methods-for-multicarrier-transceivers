# DL Methods for Multicarrier Transceivers

The scripts presented here are part of my Master thesis and allow training and 
evaluation of autoencoders, that are able to transmit data over a wireless channel,
using TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. The trained autoencoder can be imported into
GNURadio for over-the-air transmission using 
[Tensorflow GNURadio Blocks](https://github.com/johschmitz/gr-tensorflow_cc).

Four examplary trained autoencoder weights can be found 
[here](https://cloud.ti.rwth-aachen.de/index.php/s/P4bADCELmJKba6N).
